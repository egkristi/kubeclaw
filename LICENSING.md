# kubeclaw — Licensing

kubeclaw uses a **dual-license model**: open source for the community,
commercial for enterprise use.

---

## Open Source Core — AGPLv3

The kubeclaw core is licensed under the
[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSES/AGPLv3.txt) (AGPLv3).

This covers:
- Transport layer (all drivers: WebSocket, QUIC, WireGuard, Reticulum, ...)
- Noise XX end-to-end encryption
- RPC executor and RPCPolicy engine
- ConnectivityPolicy and negotiator
- Metrics collection and outputs
- Bootstrap and relay

**AGPLv3 in plain English:**
- Free to use, modify, and distribute
- If you modify and run it as a service (SaaS), you must publish your modifications
- If you distribute it as part of a product, that product must also be AGPLv3
- Protects against cloud providers silently forking and offering as managed service

---

## Commercial License — Enterprise

A commercial license is required if you:

1. Use kubeclaw commercially with **>50 managed agents** and **>$5M revenue/year**
2. Distribute kubeclaw inside a product **without** releasing your source under AGPLv3
3. Offer kubeclaw as a **hosted/managed service** without releasing modifications

A commercial license grants:
- Usage rights without AGPLv3 obligations
- Access to enterprise-only features (see below)
- Priority support and SLA options

See [LICENSES/COMMERCIAL.txt](LICENSES/COMMERCIAL.txt) for full terms.

## Why AGPLv3?

We chose AGPLv3 over MIT/Apache 2.0 deliberately:

**The SaaS loophole:** MIT and Apache 2.0 allow cloud providers to offer kubeclaw
as a managed service, fork it, add proprietary features, and never contribute back.
This happened to MongoDB (AWS DocumentDB), Elasticsearch (AWS OpenSearch), and
Redis. AGPLv3 closes this loophole — if you run it as a service, your modifications
must be open.

**We commit to the core staying open:** The transport, crypto, RPC, and policy
layers will remain AGPLv3 forever. We will never pull a HashiCorp (BSL switch) or
a Redis (RSAL switch). Enterprise features that we build on top may be commercial,
but the foundation will not be.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributors to kubeclaw must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
This allows us to offer the commercial license while accepting community contributions.

The CLA grants us the right to:
- Include your contribution in the AGPLv3 release
- Include your contribution in commercial releases

It does NOT transfer copyright ownership. You retain copyright over your contributions.

CLA signature: [TODO — link when available]
